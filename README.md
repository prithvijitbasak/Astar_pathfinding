# A Star Pathfinding Algorithm Visualiser
This program gives a graphical visualisation of shortest path between two points using A star Pathfinding Algorithm.
# Getting Started
## Dependencies
- Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
- Python 3.7 
- pygame module
## Executing Program
- Download main.py script and run from terminal window or text editor.
- Click anywhere in the grid to set the source position it will turn in orange colour.
- Click for the second time to choose the destination position anywhere in the grid it will turn in turquoise colour.
- Now click for the barriers where you want to put it will turn black.
- To change the already selected source and destination position in anywhere in the grid then just right click on the selected positions and it will turn white and then left click on the position where you want to put the source or the destination.
- To change the positions of the barriers, the process is same as above.
- After setting the source, destination and the barriers hit the space button to see the magic of the algorithm.
- The algorithm stops working after getting the shortest path to reach destination from the source.
- The shortest path will be in purple colour.
- Press 'c' (without single quotes) to restart the algorithm.
